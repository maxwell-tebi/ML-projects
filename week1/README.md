# Olympic Trophy Prediction Model
A machine learning project that uses linear regression to estimate the number of trophies/medals an athletic team will win in the next Olympic Games.

## Description
This model leverages historical performance data to find the linear relationship between specific team variables and their final medal counts. It is built using the Scikit-learn library in Python.

## Features
1. Data cleaning and normalization for historical Olympic datasets.

2. Linear regression implementation via Scikit-learn.

3. Evaluation metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
